This workshop allowed me to understand how to manage the resources of a derived class without having loads of memory problems.
It also gave me further practice on creating well defined copy constructors and copy assignments.
I was also required to explicitly invoke the Text:: copy assignment inside of the HtmlText:: copy assignment which gave me
further insight into how copy assignment works in a derived class whose base class also has resources that are managed with
a copy assignment. Same thing with the copy constructor but this time I initialized the base class resources by invoking a
constructor of my choosing, using the derived classes constructor.
