The only problem I really ran into for the duration of this workshop is char array memory allocation, specifically, remembering to add the + 1 for the null terminator byte at the end of the array. I ended up debugging with the visual studio debugger and then finding the string that was causing the problem. I ended up placing it on a watchlist and viola, I eventually realized that it had to be a semantic error regarding memory allocation.

That was really the only trouble I had for the duration of the entire workshop, everything else was easy as pie.

The only really interesting thing I learned throughout the entire project was this:

ostringstream

This object allows you to store text that you want to display on the screen, which is very handy for member functions that require ostream& returns.
