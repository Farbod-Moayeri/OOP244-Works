This workshop allowed me to get familiar with the concept of inheritance and it taught me how to use the base classes constructor using the
derived class's constructor. I also learned about using a constructor initialization list which helps make your code cleaner and easier to
read. I also learned how to use qualified function calls to call the base classes functions. This is especially useful when your derived
class and your base class have member methods that have the same name. Normally, your derived classes member methods are invoked first, so
you use scope resolution, i.e a qualified member method call, to resolve the scope you want. That is about all I learned this workshop.
