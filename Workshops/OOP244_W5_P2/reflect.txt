This workshop allowed me to understand the practical application of operator overloading and also how to define them properly. While I was learning about this concept in class, it was a bit too abstract to fully comprehend until I began working on the workshop.

I also did not understand the concept of helper functions that well until I worked on the workshop. I now understand that helper functions are mainly used when direct access to data members is not a necessity to perform an operation on the class. Such operations include certain operator overloads where neither operand changes, or some other action.

The only thing I felt was difficult to understand and what I stumbled upon was on part 2 of the workshop where I had to create a += operator overload for mark that was outside of the class. What confused me is that the operator overload for += had a different amount of parameters depending on if it was within the class or not. Eventually I understood that the function was a helper function and that it had to be placed outside the class.
